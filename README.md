# Data Preparation and Modelling

After importing the data from the data source, performed data cleaning and data modelling using excel to prepare the data into required format.

# Data Visualization

An interactive and insightful dashboard is created that using tableau public which shows high-level overview of multiple parameters and KPIs. Different types of visualization methods like Line chart,  Bar chart, Pie chart, Donut chart, Table, Map are used.

Filters for top automakers, states, EV types and CAFV eligibility are made for better interactivity and experience.

# Insights

1. Total number of vehicle produced from 2014 to January of 2024 is 171004.

2. Average MSRP (Manufactures Suggested Retail Price) is $51915. 
(vehicles whose price is not decided by the manufactures yet are not considered here)
3. Average electric range is 125.9km. 
(vehicles whose range is not tested are not considered here)

4. The state of Washington is the EV hotspot as more than 95% of the vehicles are in Washington.

5. The BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) got more popularity than PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) over the years. PHEV has the growth curve almost flat but BEV got an exponential growth curve and reached its peak in 2023 with a total of almost 51k vehicle production.
(As the data for 2024 is not complete, so we are seeing a dip in 2024)

BEV contributes to approx. 79% of total EVs produced.

6. Tesla is the top EV maker as it contributes almost half of total EVs (approx. 49%). Other top EV makers are Chevrolet, Nissan, Ford, BMW, Kia and together they contribute to almost 30% of total EV production.

7. Tesla's Model X and Model Y are the top selling vehicles and  have approx. 21% and 18% market share respectively. Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model X and Chevrolet Bolt EV come next and contribute to approx. 6%, 4% and 4% of total EVs produced.

8. From the total EVs produced CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility for almost 54 % of vehicles are unknown as the range of those vehicles are not tested yet.

Approx. 35% of total EVs are already CAFV eligible and the rest (approx. 11%) vehicles are not CAFV eligible as those vehicles got lesser range than CAFV standard.
